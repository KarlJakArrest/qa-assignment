# Weather forecast application

Create a simple weather forecast application using React.js. Utilize a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch weather data based on the user's search query. The application should allow users to search for a city and display its current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, and any other relevant information.

## **Requirements:**

1. **User Interface:**
    - The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface.
    - Include an input field for users to enter a city name and a button to submit the search query.
    - Display the current weather conditions for the searched city, including temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, etc.
    - Make sure to handle cases where the city entered by the user is not found or the API request fails.
    - Make sure the application is visually consistent across different screen sizes.
    - Apply CSS styles to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.
2. **Functionality:**
    - Utilize a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch weather data based on the user's search query.
    - Users should be able to search for a city and view its current weather conditions.
    - Implement error handling for cases where the city entered is not found or the API request fails.
3. **State Management:**
    - Utilize state management in React.js to manage state (Redux optional, based on candidate's familiarity)
    - Ensure that changes in the user's search query and the retrieved weather data are reflected in the application's state and UI accordingly.
4. **Additional Features (Optional):**
    - Implement additional features like displaying weather forecasts for the upcoming days, allowing users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit, or providing weather icons for different weather conditions.
